# A Structured 60-Day Intensive Python Learning Plan: From Fundamentals to Machine Learning Applications

## I. Introduction
This document outlines a rigorous 60-day learning plan designed to advance an individual from a beginner to an intermediate/advanced level in Python programming, with a specific focus on data manipulation, machine learning, and an introduction to deep learning. The plan necessitates a dedicated commitment of four hours per day.

The pedagogical approach integrates:
- Theoretical understanding
- Hands-on coding exercises
- Project-based learning

The curriculum is structured into distinct phases:
- **Phase 1**: Core Python Fundamentals
- **Phase 2**: Data Science Libraries (NumPy, Pandas)
- **Phase 3**: Machine Learning and Deep Learning (scikit-learn, PyTorch)

The learning journey emphasizes Python's core data structures and progresses to machine learning and CNNs in PyTorch. This plan includes freely available online resources, such as official documentation, academic courses, and practical exercises. Creating custom Python packages or modules is explicitly excluded.
