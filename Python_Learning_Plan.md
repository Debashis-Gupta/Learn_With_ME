# A Structured 60-Day Intensive Python Learning Plan: From Fundamentals to Machine Learning Applications

## I. Introduction

This document outlines a rigorous 60-day learning plan to advance from beginner to intermediate/advanced Python programming, focusing on data manipulation, machine learning, and introductory deep learning. It requires a commitment of four hours daily, integrating theoretical understanding, hands-on coding, and project-based learning. The curriculum progresses through:

- **Core Python fundamentals**: Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- **Data science libraries**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Machine learning**: Scikit-learn for feature engineering and traditional models
- **Deep learning**: Introduction to PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Custom Python package creation is excluded. The plan uses freely available resources, including Python.org, Harvard CS50P, MIT 6.0001, Stanford Code in Place, and platforms like Kaggle and LeetCode.

## II. Daily Study Structure

The daily four-hour schedule is structured as follows:

- **Theory & Conceptual Understanding (1.5 hours)**: Engage with books, articles, documentation, and video lectures.
- **Coding Exercises & Practical Application (2 hours)**: Write code, complete exercises, and implement concepts.
- **Review & Planning (0.5 hours)**: Review daily topics, consolidate notes, and plan for the next session.

## III. The 60-Day Learning Plan

The plan is divided into phases, with daily activities, key concepts, resources, and exercises/projects. Below is a sample of the schedule from the provided document.
